# 42GoShare Plugin for Obsidian

Share a note with an ephimeral public link.

## Usage

- Chose "Share note" from any note's contextual menu
- it the shortcut "Shift+Cmd+s" to share the note and open the popup with the note's link.
- type "Share note" in the _Command Palette_.

## Be Careful What You Share!

The shared note _title_ and _content_ **is copied** to a temporary record on the _42Go's Sync Server_ and the URL gives full read access to such note.

> Notes are not redable after 60 minutes and are automatically pruned from the server after 4 hours.

ğŸ§¨ Nevertheless, be careful what you share because **it is your own responsibility**.

## Settings

In the plugin's setting you can change the sync server to any compatible server.

The default sync server is `https://notes.42go.dev` that is a small utility that lets share temporary Markdown notes without any account.

ğŸš§ You can change the server at will and the specs to build your own server will be published soon ğŸš§.
